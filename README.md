# One_Figure_A_Day_Challenge
This is something I have decided to do to make something good come out of the current covid situation. Here I will put the publicly available source code of drawing specific figures each day which anyone can access. The idea being to improve my coding skills in visualization as well as to make people interested in coding.
The figures will be shared through my FB account : https://www.facebook.com/shohan1992/
